# Bert Classifier for 20 Newsgroup Dataset

## Introduction
This is a group project that was part of my Natural Language Processing course. We were tasked to classify the dataset using Bert model and compare various techniques and hyperparametes.

## Process
This is mentioned in great detail in the report. The basics are given below:
- Create the model as the bert model and the classifier model being a hidden layer of a fully connected 512 and output of 20.
- Break the data into Train, Test and validation.
- Fine tune the model on Train dataset and ensure the model doesnt overfit.
- Try various hyperparameters to optimize training and get best results.
- Test on testing dataset and on various articles picked from google.
